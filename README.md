# DriverPass System Design

## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project
The DriverPass project focused on creating a system that would help people prepare for their driver’s test. The client wanted a system where students could access practice tests, track their progress, and schedule lessons with instructors. My role was to gather the requirements from the client and design a system that could meet those needs.

## What did you do particularly well?
I did a good job breaking down the client’s requirements into clear, organized sections. I also made sure my diagrams matched the written design so it was easy to see how the pieces of the system worked together.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I had the chance to improve one part, I would refine some of the diagrams. I would make them easier to read by simplifying the layout and removing extra details that were not necessary. This would help future developers understand the system faster.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I designed the system around what the users needed most: easy access to tests, lesson scheduling, and progress tracking. Thinking about the user is important because even a system with good features can fail if it is confusing or hard to use.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When I design software, I start by listening closely to the client and understanding their goals. From there, I use diagrams, requirements lists, and feedback to shape the system. In the future, I want to focus more on creating prototypes and involving users early, so I can spot problems before the system is fully built.
